This is my submission ofr ECON 832 final. The task was to predict choice behavior using CPC18 dataset of choice problems, applying neural network modeling
and integrating risk preference and attention-related covariates.

Please run the file in this order to reproduce the results :

1. Run GetDistribution.py
2. Run the first part of DataPrep.do ==> Get baseline and augmented dataset and
3. Run the first part of ChoicePrediction.jl ==> Get Accuracy rate
4. Run the second part of DataPrep.do ==> Get rate of choosing B
5.  Run the second part of ChoicePrediction.jl ==> Get MSE
